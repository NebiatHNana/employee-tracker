# Employee-Tracker

### User Story
As a user, I require a command-line programme that will track my business's personnel. 
### Features
This app has a command line interface that communicates with the user.
This app will display a menu prompting the user to:

When a user enters the requested data, the database is subjected to the appropriate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, or Delete) action.
