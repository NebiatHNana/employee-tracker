# Employee-Tracker

### User Story
As a user, I require a command-line programme that will track my business's personnel. I want to be able to view my departments, my personnel, and their roles by responding to command prompt inquiries. I want to be able to delete departments and create new ones as a user. As a user, I would also appreciate the capacity to modify a worker's role. I want to be able to add and remove employees as a user. I should be asked to submit the employee's name, department, and job when I request to add an employee. the name, ID, role, department, and salary of each person when I view them should then be returned..
### Features
This app features a command line interface that interacts with the user.
This app will prompt the user with a menu to :
View all employees
Add an Employee
Delete an Employee
Update Employee Role
View All Roles
Add a Role
View All departments
Add a Department
Delete a Department
When a user inputs the requested data the appropriate CRUD(Create, Read, Update or Delete) action is applied to the databse.
